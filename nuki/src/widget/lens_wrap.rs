/// A wrapper for its widget subtree to have access to a part
/// of its parent's data.
///
/// Every widget in druid is instantiated with access to data of some
/// type; the root widget has access to the entire application data.
/// Often, a part of the widget hierarchy is only concerned with a part
/// of that data. The `LensWrap` widget is a way to "focus" the data
/// reference down, for the subtree. One advantage is performance;
/// data changes that don't intersect the scope of the lens aren't
/// propagated.
///
/// Another advantage is generality and reuse. If a widget (or tree of
/// widgets) is designed to work with some chunk of data, then with a
/// lens that same code can easily be reused across all occurrences of
/// that chunk within the application state.
///
/// This wrapper takes a [`Lens`] as an argument, which is a specification
/// of a struct field, or some other way of narrowing the scope.
